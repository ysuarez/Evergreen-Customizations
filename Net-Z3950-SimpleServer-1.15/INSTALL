Building and installation
-------------------------
1. Requirements

The Net::Z3950::SimpleServer Perl module requires the YAZ toolkit.
Version 4 or later is recommended. You can download it via this link:

	http://ftp.indexdata.dk/pub/yaz/

You need to configure the YAZ toolkit with the command

	% ./configure

Then compile and install

	% make
	# make install

You don't *need* to install YAZ globally on your machine if you
prefer not to. In this case, you just have to update the Makefile.PL
with the locations of the libraries.

2. Installation

Unpack the tar ball this way

	% gunzip Net-Z3950-SimpleServer-xxxx.tar.gz
	% tar xvf Net-Z3950-SimpleServer-xxxx.tar.gz

and cd to the root directory of the module package

	% cd Net-Z3950-SimpleServer-xxxx

The installation takes place by issuing the following commands:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	# make install

The last command has to be issued as super user.

Good luck!
